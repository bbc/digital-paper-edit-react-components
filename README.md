# Digital Paper Edit - React Components Catalogue

[The Storybook](https://bbc.github.io/digital-paper-edit-storybook/?path=/story/breadcrumb--projects)

---> _Work in progress_ <--

**! What is published in the Storybook may be different to what is being actively used in Digital-Paper-Edit-Client, as the components are currently being migrated. !**

This repository uses [storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to gather the components of the React front end. You can read about the "why" in [this ADR](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-storybook/blob/9755e2c62343decf05ec87b9c7d85678d58e2186/docs/ADR/reason-09-11.md).

See [here](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-client#project-architecture) for the overall project architecture.

## Build

<!-- _How to run build_ -->

- [ ] TODO

<!-- > To transpile `./packages` and create a build in the `./dist` folder, run:

```
npm run build:component
``` -->

## Demo & storybook

- **Storybook** can bew viewed at [https://bbc.github.io/digital-paper-edit-storybook/](https://bbc.github.io/digital-paper-edit-storybook/)
- **Demo** can be viewed at [https://bbc.github.io/digital-paper-edit-client](https://bbc.github.io/digital-paper-edit-client/)

## Build - storybook

To build the storybook as a static site

```sh
npm run build:storybook
```

## Publish storybook & demo to github pages

This github repository uses [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the storybook and the demo of the component. **Make sure to commit and push any changes to MASTER before deploying to github pages.**

```sh
npm run deploy:ghpages
```

Alternatively, if you simply want to build the demo locally in the `build` folder then just

```sh
npm run build:storybook
```

you can then run this command to serve the static site locally

```sh
npm run build:storybook:serve
```

## Tests

<!-- _How to carry out tests_ -->

Test coverage using [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/), to run tests

```
npm run test
```

During development you can use

```
npm run test:watch
```

## Travis CI

- [ ] TODO

<!-- On commit this repo uses the [.travis.yml](./.travis.yml) config tu run the automated test on [travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/bbc/react-transcript-editor). -->

## Deployment

<!-- _How to deploy the code/app into test/staging/production_ -->

- [ ] TODO

<!-- To push to [npm - `@bbc/react-transcript-editor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bbc/react-transcript-editor)

```
npm publish:public
```

This runs `npm run build:component` and `npm publish --access public` under the hood
