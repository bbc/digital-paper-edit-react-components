# Digital Paper Edit - React Components Catalogue

[The Storybook](https://bbc.github.io/digital-paper-edit-storybook/?path=/story/breadcrumb--projects)

---> _Work in progress_ <--

**! What is published in the Storybook may be different to what is being actively used in Digital-Paper-Edit-Client, as the components are currently being migrated. !**

This repository uses [storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to gather the components of the React front end. You can read about the "why" in [this ADR](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-storybook/blob/9755e2c62343decf05ec87b9c7d85678d58e2186/docs/ADR/reason-09-11.md).

See [here](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-client#project-architecture) for the overall project architecture.
